(32, 'contactmnnjnu', '123456789', 'solopinacelestina1991@rambler.ru', 'We are happy to welcome you! \r\n \r\nNewsletters  of Your offers via follow-up forms to the sites of firms via all countries and domain zones of the world.  \r\n \r\nhttps://xn----7sbb1bbndheurc1a.xn--p1ai/ \r\n \r\nWHAT IS THE MAILING OF WEBSITES BY FEEDBACK FORMS? \r\nThis is a type of mailing using the feedback forms that are located in the contact section of the website and filled by our programme in automatic mode with a rate of a few thousand contact forms per one minute, while the alphabetic and numeric code from the pictures (CAPTCHA) is also solved. \r\nAfter that, the letters including your cooperation offers are sent to the mailboxes of businesses. \r\nWhen sending mailing by contact feedback forms, it turns out that each internet resource sends a letter â€œto itselfâ€ and, therefore, all messages arrive in the inbox folder of the exact mailbox in which the firm is ready to receive the correspondent emails. \r\n \r\nUTP: \r\nFast 100-percent informing of companies and site owners about new cooperation offers. \r\nSearch of new customers that other advertisements cannot find. \r\n \r\nAIM: \r\nFinding customers that cannot be found through other advertisements. \r\n \r\nBenefits: \r\n1.one hundred % delivery of business messages. \r\n2.Expansion of the client database. \r\n3. Increase of the your market segment. \r\n4.Mailings based on regionality and topics. \r\n5. Sending e-mails to company officials. \r\n6. Conducting tenders. \r\n7. Conducting marketing campaigns. \r\n8. Studying public opinion and conducting surveys. \r\n9. Fast notofication. \r\n10. Price. \r\n11. Entering the markets of other countries. \r\n \r\nCompetitive advantages: \r\n \r\n1.When sending mailing by contact forms, all messages arrive in the inbox. When sending mass e-mails, this can reach up to 5 percent. \r\n \r\n2.When sending mailing by contact forms it is possible to send a few million messages per 24 hours to inbox folders. When sending mass e-mails a few thousands arrive in the inbox folders, all the rest often either do not reach or arrive in the spam. \r\n \r\n3. When sending mailing by contact forms an e-mail does not get blocked by mail systems because it is sent from different sites. When sending e-newsletters it is possible to send a few thousands of those but nevertheless all the IP addresses from which the mailing is done will be banned. \r\n \r\n4. When sending mailing by feedback forms the minimum of macros is used to form text and headings of the letter. When sending e-mail newsletters, it is necessary to use Â«macrosÂ» (synonyms) for each phrase and create ten thousand various headings. \r\n \r\n5. Many businesses deliberatelly hide their email and only leave a contact form for contacting with them. \r\n \r\n6. When sending bulk e-mails, your business offer can be delivered to every employee of the company, (which causes irritation) compared to mailing by feedback forms where the letter is received at the e-mail address specifically set up for commercial offers. \r\n \r\n7.Fifty % of business e-mails are placed on free mail servers, they are poorly \"searchable\" by e-mail, but when sending mailing by contact forms through these e-mail servers, all messages are hundred % delivered to the recipients. \r\n \r\n8. Only thirty-forty percent of companies are placed in the directories within two-three years, and all the other ones are already located in our VOIS databases and are waiting for your cooperation  offers. \r\nIt turns out that that mailboxes of organisations from directories are spammed, and therefore they will not have such outcome as when sending mailing by contact forms using our new WHOIS databases. \r\n \r\n9. Any kind of stop words in the headings or body of the letter can be sent through contact forms. When sending e-mail newsletters, such letters either do not reach the recipient or end up in junk. \r\nThe list of stop words of mails includes almost all phrases and words that encourage recipients to take actions. \r\n \r\nApplication: \r\n \r\n1. Expanding the customer base. \r\n2. Quick informing of marketplaces about new commercial offers. \r\n3. Accessing directors. \r\n4.Supply. \r\n5. Conducting tenders. \r\n6.Conducting marketing research. \r\n7.Studying public opinion and conducting surveys. \r\n8. Searching for clients abroad. \r\n \r\nReasons for purchasing this service: \r\n \r\n1. 100% delivery of your e-mails and commercial offers to millions of companies all over the world. \r\nEvery site sends a e-mail to itself so all filters of mail systems are bypassed. \r\n \r\n2.Mailing by contact forms is an great way in for conducting all sorts of marketing researches, studies and surveys of  social opinion on any kind ofdirection and type of activity. \r\nWhen sending mailing by feedback forms, you will will be absolutely sure that your message has been delivered to 100% of consumers of your service and product and if a product or service is \"badly promoted\", then the potential issue lies in in something else, for example in pricing. \r\nAt the same time, within one week you will see demand for your products and services, you will not need to spend money on renting an office and other more expensive and time-consuming marketing events. \r\n \r\n3.Mailing by feedback forms is the most economical and quickest way to get your service or product to the international markets. \r\n \r\n4. Mailing by feedback forms is a tool for conducting different tenders. \r\n \r\n5.Weekly update of the database, as more than 150,000 new websites, are registered all over the world every day, and you, get potentially new customers. \r\n \r\n6. Full geographical scope for all states of the globe. \r\n \r\n7. We offer customers that are not available through other types of advertisement. \r\nWhen sending mailing by contact forms, you will be able to reach out that part of your customers, that are impossible to find automatically in another way. \r\nFor instance, you will be able to deliver a cooperation offer to those potential customers that were previously unavailable due to e-mail filters while sending mass e-mails. \r\nIn reality, there is a paradoxical situation: firms that got into the directories are actually filled with spam with all sorts of cooperation offers while very little or no e-mails are sent to the rest. \r\n \r\n8. Unique technology of decoding the captcha. \r\nThere are services for decoding alphanumeric code (captcha/CAPTCHA). It costs 1 dollar to solve 1000  CAPTCHAs. \r\nTherefore, processing one million sites our robot decodes 1 million captchas, which costs thousand $ only to solve captcha/CAPTCHA, and with our service this is free of charge for you! \r\n \r\n9. By ordering mailing by contact forms, you are promoting your product or service not to separate individuals, but to organisations, for example domain zone .com, where more than one hundred and fifty million business  companies from all countries of the world are accumulated (we have got samples of them from international zones for every state). \r\n \r\n10. Mailing by feedback forms is also a type of SMS mailing \r\nElectronic address that is linked to the feedback form is the primary electronic address of firms through which applications and cooperation offers are sent. This e-mail is also set up for phones as it is necessary to respond to the messages very fast so as not to misplace the order or the relevance of the commercial offer. \r\n \r\n11. The base of countries also includes all joint organisations from all countries working with or closely related to this country, for instance, diasporas and national communities. \r\nBan, sanctions of search engines and mail systems? \r\nThese mailings are an alternative to sending bulk e-mails, therefore search sanctions and \"BAN\" do not apply to them. \r\nMail service delivers the data of e-mails to the inbox folder, as it goes through the \"warm channel\" from the new IP address of the internet resource to the corporate e-mail address of the same website. \r\nIn other words, these mailings \"live in emails\" and mail filters do not respond to them, because mail systems have a great level of trust in communication channels between sites and corporate e-mail addresses. \r\n \r\nOUR DATABASES: \r\n \r\nYou can purchase our databases separately from the mailing by sending us a request by feedback form. \r\n \r\nMORE THAN 2000 WHOIS DATABASES BY DOMAINS AND COUNTRIES OF THE WHOLE WORLD. \r\n \r\nCOLLECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN CONTINENTS. \r\n \r\nSELECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN WORLD LANGUAGES. \r\n \r\nSELECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN CMS. \r\n \r\nSELECTIONS BY THE MAIN COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD. \r\n \r\nHOW TO MAKE AN PROMOTIONAL OFFER FOR MAILING BY FEEDBACK FORMS: \r\nThe simplest text of the message + headings, the main goal is to interest the customer, and they will read the rest on your website. \r\nMost likely, all ads on your subject are already on the Internet, enter the necessary requests into the search engine and choose the most relevant ones. \r\nThe headings are substituted one after another from .txt file. \r\nOnly text messages are sent, links are inserted without problems, they are active. If the potential customer needs pictures or more specific information, then you should forward the future customer to visit your website. \r\n \r\nIn the letter: \r\nText without pictures, since pictures do not pass through the contact form. \r\nYour contact details: \r\nWebsite address: \r\n \r\nFields to fill in: \r\nName: \r\nCountry: \r\nCity: \r\nSite: \r\nSeveral headings: \r\nE-mail address for automatic responces: \r\n \r\nwebsite: https://xn----7sbb1bbndheurc1a.xn--p1ai/ \r\nPrice List: https://xn----7sbb1bbndheurc1a.xn--p1ai/en/price/', NULL, '2021-12-05 19:15:05', NULL, 0),

With the maida-based snacks category largely remaining a part of the unorganized market so far, <a href=\"https://bikano.com/amp/\" target=\"_blank\">Bikano</a> is entering the segment with intent to make it organized, offer branded product range and to ensure both hygiene & taste for patrons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Particularly with an eye on the Hindi-speaking market, the launch of these products would not only add to the ever-expanding product portfolio of the snack company and boost its revenues, but also further cement Bikanoâ€™s position as one of the most popular and leading snacks brands in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">â€œWith these items, we not only wish to help patrons relive the tradition involving regular savouries that accompany their chai-drinking, but also expand the range of snack options that they often combine with their beverages. As such, these maida-based savories high on hygiene become a delectable complement to the tea or coffee that they often drink. Apart from satisfying their mid-meal cravings and filling the void in their snacking routines, because these are filling enough, these lip-smacking items can sometimes even serve as a substitute for regular meals when one is travelling, or is stationed in a remote place. Suitably filled in 200 gm convenience packs, they are easy to carry and consume anywhere anytime, <strong>said Mr.</strong> <strong>Manish Aggarwal, Director, Bikano</strong>.Â </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">â€œChai time snacks are a popular category in the Indian snacking market.<a href=\"https://bikano.com/amp/\" target=\"_blank\"> Bikanoâ€™s</a> new range of maida-based offerings attempts to provide salty and tangy snacks with the added goodness of taste and hygiene for its snack-lovers. Even during the tough Covid times, Bikano has continued to carry out market due diligence, maintain the spotlight on distribution and undertake brand-building through focused product campaigns with an eye on improving revenue growth. With COVID-19 showing no signs of relenting plus the fear of the incoming third wave, normalcy is unlikely to return in this quarter too. With all that in mind, we have started to build our innovation funnel slowly and this new range of chai-time snacks is one step towards it. With Bikanoâ€™s core competency being in the snacking segment, the launch of these products will give a further competitive advantage to the brand,â€ <strong>said Mr Dawinder Pal, Head of Marketing, Bikano.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Punjab, Delhi, UP, Rajasthan, Haryana, J&K, Himachal Pradesh, MP and Chhattisgarh would be key target markets for the company in the initial phase.

This year, India\'s leading packaged snacks brand Bikano is back with their exclusive gift range for Rakhi offering an exciting combination of different sweets, snacks, namkeen and cookies meant to match the requirements of consumers during Rakhi celebrations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the gifting category, packaged food gifting items have always been favoured irrespective of any season or festivals. <a href=\"https://bikano.com/amp/\" target=\"_blank\">Bikano</a> is coming out with new product launches and attractive gift packs to meet the expectations of consumers in terms of innovative gifting options for the special occasion of Rakhi.

This range of new gift packs for Rakhi sum up as the ideal gift option for both sisters and brothers making the occasion more special and heart-warming. These hampers are a great reminder of love and care for a brother or sister as it contains a great combination of flavoursâ€ said <strong>Mr. Manish Aggarwal, Director, Bikano</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>â€œConsumer gifting is a vast and growing market. While we continue to focus on quality, packaging and new promotions to create excitement with the trade and the customers, we are equally focused on developing value offerings and product lines with the affordability mindset so as to drive higher salesâ€ added <strong>Mr. Aggarwal</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Personal gifting has witnessed a rise over the recent past and an ever-higher number of occasions are being added to the tally. Consumers today want a touch of uniqueness, style and personalization in their gift items to match their status. Thanks to rising income levels and standard of living, the gifting industry in the country has registered strong growth over the past decade.Â </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of the same, <strong>Mr. Dawinder Pal, Head of Marketing at Bikano</strong> said â€œGifting is an indispensable part of any festive occasion especially Rakhi. Gifting in the food category has been traditionally dominated by sweets, chocolates and dry fruits.

With a view to contribute to the larger Covid-19 vaccination drive underway in the country, the company took the responsibility of vaccinating and thereby securing the health of over 220 of its employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">The government is providing free vaccination to all age groups except for the kids in the age group of 12-18. However, it is likely that by July-end or August, the vaccination drive for kids will also commence. With this, the broader message that goes out is that the COVID-19 vaccine is not only the most potent way of shielding against the virus, but it is indispensable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">â€œAt a time of such great uncertainty and fear, when people are not sure how the pandemic would play out in the coming months, or if there is a third wave coming our way with even more deadly mutants and variants as is being widely discussed in public forums as well as private conversations, getting oneself vaccinated is perhaps the most practicable way of protecting and keeping safe against the deadly virus. Of course, the government has done all that it can to accelerate the pace of vaccination intending to inoculate as many Indians as possible in as little time. However, we understand that there are practical challenges relating to supply, logistics and administration which have hindered the progress of the campaign as desired. As a result, many willing people wanting to be injected as soon as possible have failed to receive their injections. And among them, there were several of our employees who were looking to get the jab, but were not being able to do so due to various reasons. With all that in mind, we took it upon ourselves to make arrangements with hospitals and vaccine manufacturers to ensure that our employees were inoculated well in time and remained in the so-called safe zone. And in this endeavour, Apollo Hospital, Sharda Hospital & Civil Hospital Sonipat have proved to be our valued partners,â€ <strong>said Mr Manish Aggarwal, Director, Bikano.</strong>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">â€œMoreover, as questions of economy and livelihoods compel the authorities to increasingly ease the lockdowns and relax rules on physical mobility, a substantial part of the workforce so far working from home has resumed their regular duties physically from office premises like before. This obviously necessitate full protection for such employees as well as protection of others from them as an asymptomatic person carrying the virus would be a threat to those around him when he steps outdoors. At the same time, vaccinating the employees and bringing some of them to work from office premises or other places as required would also galvanize our business operations and efficiency thereby helping us contribute to the national mission of reviving the economy in a better and more effective way, <strong>said Mr Aggarwal further.Â Â Â  </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">The vaccination programme was conducted in phases - first at the companyâ€™s corporate office on June 7 and then at their Greater Noida factory on June 14, and at Rai factory on 21st June and 28th June.

The major factors driving increased consumption in the extrudes snacks categories are the growing youth and young population, rising per capita income and competitive pricing as well as the introduction of smaller packs. The primary buyers in the segment are the kids and young population. Since these extrude snacking options require no preparation or cooking, they are convenient to eat at home or take to school.

The reason: The resort has a deep commitment to sustainability and recycles and repurposes almost all waste generated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nâ€œThis inspired the team to re-look at how our products are packed and delivered,â€ says Anupama Gupta, chief operating officer, Good Earth. â€œSince then, we have researched and experimented with various packaging materials.â€</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Good Earth started by introducing the crumping process, for which it uses 70% recycled paper and 30% virgin craft paper. â€œToday, we are on our way to instituting sustainable packaging across our product universe,â€ says Gupta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Finding its place</strong><br>\r\nWhen it comes to packaging, it seems the bubble (wrap) has burst. According to Acumen Research and Consulting, a global market intelligence firm, global sustainable packaging market is expected to reach around $255 billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 7% over the forecast period of 2019-26.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA June 2021 report by the Metal Container Manufacturersâ€™ Association (MCMA) said that the sustainable packaging industry in India is expected to grow by 4-6% and reach around 770-800 kilo tonnes (KT) by 2024.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFashion commentator NamrataÂ ZakariaÂ feels that brands are no longer built by the four Ps ofÂ marketingÂ â€“ product, price, placement and promotion. â€œPeople and planet count too. And thanks to rising customer awareness, they matter the most,â€ she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile consumers have been ethically buying for a while now, Zakaria says itâ€™s time FMCGs did their bit. â€œThey only have a recycling sign as a request to the consumer. Which basically means, that â€˜theyâ€™ damage the environment by using mass and cheap quality packaging, but itâ€™s â€˜yourâ€™ job to recycle and clean it up for them,â€ she says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\"><strong>Consumption vs consciousness</strong><br>\r\nWriter and beauty content creator Vasudha Raiâ€™s social media post promoting sustainability went viral in 2019 when she shared a picture standing alongside stacked gift boxes, with the message that she would no longer be accepting free beauty products as PR gifts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRai feels the onus of packaging needs to be shifted from the consumer to the companies. â€œConsumption is never 100% sustainable. True sustainability will come when we close that loop of consumption. Companies need to address what happens to the bottle once the product is over. Only then can the circle of consumption will be closed.â€<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor instance, Kirti Poonia of rural artisans-led brand Okhai has shifted to 100% compostable packaging in the past two years despite the cost increasing almost five times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough committed to the cause of sustainability, Poonia says there are also multiple challenges with compostable packaging. Most of it is not home compostable and India has only eight industrial composting units. â€œSo, we are discovering loopholes as we discover the solution,â€ says Poonia, adding, â€œIf you are a sustainable fashion brand, packaging is a key aspect. The brand cannot align with sustainability values if the delivery mechanism is unsustainable.â€<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRai, however, says that sustainability in consumption is a massive grey area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to Prateek Gupte, who founded Mumbai-based refill and reuse company Restore, India generates more than 25,940 tonnes of plastic waste every single day and 40% of this is from packaging alone. â€œRecycling cannot solve this problem for two reasons: Recycling downgrades the quality of the plastic and second, it is not economically viable. We are in desperate need of more solutions,â€ Gupte says, adding, â€œToday, beauty comes at the cost of the planet not looking good.â€<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 10% CAGR, plastic usage in India is set to double over the next five to 10 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Beauty spot</strong><br>\r\nFor fashion and beauty businesses, says Zakaria, sustainable packaging is a good look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thatâ€™s probably why beauty businesses are looking within for a change of look. Enter brands like asa, which has a refillable programme for all its products.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkincare brand Ilana has also started an initiative, #emptiestoearth, where it encourages customers to return their empties to the brand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamrath Bedi, executive director of Forest Essentials, says that by switching bottling of formulations inÂ eco-friendlyÂ PET bottles and glass jars, they have reduced plastic usage by 70%.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLâ€™Occitane as a group has pledged that by 2025, 100% of its bottles will be made out of 100% recycled plastic, and 100% of owned stores will offer a recycling service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to Harsh Agarwal of Jaipur-based luxury menswear brand HARAGO, shifting to sustainable packaging can help boost brand image. helps boost six months ago. â€œConsumers now call out brands and tell them right from wrong,â€ he says, adding that they shifted to eco-friendly packaging six months ago despite the cost going up by Rs 10 per shipment. â€œThis small change contributed towards a positive brand image, as our customers noticed the change and pointed it out.â€<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSocial media has played a role as well. In July 2021, the Flipkart Group (that includes Flipkart and Myntra) announced its tie-up with not-for-profit environmental organization Canopy for sustainable packaging â€” a move that won brownie points on social media.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than the social currency, says Hemant Sagar, co-founder and designer of Genes Lecoanet Hemant, itâ€™s a way to showcase brand image. â€œPackaging definitely is a big part of communicating brand values and helps position the identity. But the discourse should be focused on responsible packaging instead of greenwashing. People do notice packaging now because who made the product and how it was made matters,â€ he adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Filling the void</strong><br>\r\nSmall businesses are thinking better. Haresh Mirpuri, creative director of handcrafted bags company Aranyani, started the brand in 2016 with a focus on nine key goals from the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBusinesses like sleepwear brand Dandelion, designers Saaksha & Kinni and shoe brand Fizzy Goblet reuse factory waste to create packaging, minimise plastic use within the brand and urge customers to repurpose boxes. Resort-wear brand Summer Somewhere has shifted to FSC-certified, acid-free paper that uses soy-based ink, as its compostable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghna Goyal, founder of Summer Somewhere, says, â€œTodayâ€™s consumer is more educated and demand transparency from companies that theyâ€™re associating themselves with. We have so many consumers reaching out to us for more details on our sustainable practices.â€<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZakaria says that itâ€™s important to note that all change comes about only when consumers ask for it. â€œConsumers must reject companies that arenâ€™t doing it right. They must refuse to buy products that are filled in plastic bottles or boxes or wrapped in plastic.â€<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe revolution is on paper now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>BOX 1: PACK OF WOES</strong><br>\r\nA march 2021Â MintelÂ report reveals that two-thirds of Indians (72%) are aware of and concerned about the issue of single-use plastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour in five Indians (79%) say thereâ€™s very little information on reducing packaging waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs many as 39% of Indian consumers expect brands to reduce the amount of plastics used in packaging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n44% say more brands should implement sustainability practices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to Mintel Global New Products Database, 82% of food launches in India in the past five years have used plastics as a primary packaging material<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>BOX 2: THE BIGGIES</strong><br>\r\nOn September 1, 2021, packaging company EPL Limited announced that it has partnered with Colgate-Palmolive India to produce recyclableÂ PlatinaÂ toothpaste tubes in India.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn June 29, 2020, Amazon India announced that it has eliminated all single-use plastic in packaging originating from its over 50 fulfilment centres in the country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy 2025, Unilever plans to make all of its plastic packaging fully reusable, recyclable or compostable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLâ€™OrÃ©al Parisâ€™ plans to make 100% of its packaging refillable or compostable by 2025.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDior, too, has revealed its new perfume products that are refillable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNykaaÂ has set up a recycling system for packaging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProcter & Gamble (P&G) India produces 25% of its shampoo and conditioner bottles with ocean plastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn 2019, Hindustan Unilever (HUL), announced that it will halve the use of virgin plastic by 2025.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Box 3: Beyond the cotton bag</strong><br>\r\nA recent report in The New York Times titled â€˜The Cotton Tote Crisisâ€™ said that an organic cotton tote needs to be used 20,000 times to offset its overall impact of production, according to a 2018 study by the Ministry of Environment and Food of Denmark.

Before COVID-19, Warner Bros. India would usually wait around six months â€” case in point,Â <em>Joker</em>Â â€” before sending them to streaming. Warner has a two-fold licensing system in India.

At present, the organisation is taking care of nearly 125 HIV positive children.', '<p class=\"text-justify\">Mangal Shah runs a residential unit called Palawi under Prabha-Hira Pratisthan, an NGO, in Pandharpur, Maharashtra, for HIV positive children. At present, the organisation is taking care of nearly 125 HIV positive children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Sixty-eight-year-old&nbsp;<strong>Mangal Shah</strong>, popularly known as Mangaltai, has dedicated her life towards humanity for the most excluded, vulnerable, and hapless children and women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Having worked with HIV+ children for about two decades now, her desire to care and support led her to be the godmother figure to over 100 such children.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5 class=\"Poppins-Bold\">Understanding the needy</h5>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Soon after her marriage, when other women in the family devoted their time on puja-archana, 17-year-old Shah was more interested in helping the needy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">On approaching a government hospital to help handicapped people, pregnant women, and HIV positive female sex workers, she understood there was lack of family support for women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Shah then decided to care for and help such people. She began providing homecooked food to the needy patients at the hospital. And soon, she realised the need to work for female sex workers who were affected by HIV/AIDS - the most excluded community of women in Solapur district in Maharashtra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Thus began Shah&rsquo;s journey, about 35-years-ago, to&nbsp;<strong>spread awareness about HIV/AIDS</strong>&nbsp;among female sex workers. This was at a time when HIV/AIDS was considered the ugliest and deadliest disease known to mankind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Recalling her journey in helping HIV positive children, Shas says, one day, when she and her daughter Dimple were working to create awareness about&nbsp;<strong>HIV/AIDS</strong>&nbsp;among the sex workers in Pandharpur, they were informed about two girl children aged 2.5 years and 1.5 years being abandoned in a cow shed as their parents had died due to AIDS. Their relatives feared that the girls would bring shame and the risk of infection to the entire family. When Shah&rsquo;s effort in persuading the villagers to look after the girls went in vain, she and Dimple decided to take them home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">They tried to find an orphanage for HIV+ children, only to realise there were no homes for HIV+ children in the district and also in entire Maharashtra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Shah decided to provide shelter and care to such children and built a home for HIV+ children by herself. The care home was named &lsquo;Palawi&rsquo;, which means the &lsquo;new leaves of a plant&rsquo; in Marathi.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&ldquo;Since 2001, we have been working with HIV+ children for their care and rehabilitation. The children and I share a very deep bond. These children feel the need for a mother&rsquo;s care. These children should feel happy and all their moments should be filled with happiness. That is what we work towards at Palawi,&rdquo; says Shah.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h5 class=\"Poppins-Bold\">Touching the lives of children</h5>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Project&nbsp;<strong>Palawi,</strong>&nbsp;under Prabha Hira Pratisthan, is an organisation in Maharashtra, which is considered as one of the hard-hit states in India in terms of prevalence of HIV/AIDS. Palawi claims to be the only such institution in Maharashtra, which has focussed on providing solutions and system-change for people living with HIV/AIDS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">At present, Palawi is funded by individual, local donations, and grants from international organisations. Palawi has also been raising funds for its work through Milaap and other crowdfunding platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">In the past 20 years, Palawi has developed various programmes and innovated multiple ideas to target the most at-risk populations. It has been creating awareness among different strata of the population and also providing residential care services for orphan children and other people affected with HIV/AIDS. It has served as a signboard for HIV positive orphan children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">According to Shah, the central focus of the organisation is to ensure rights, equality, and citizenship. She says, with the help of 50 office employees and over 50 volunteers, Palawi has ensured access to treatment and care services for people living with HIV and HIV positive children, mitigated stigma, and has built an agency among individuals from underserved and marginalised groups, and their families who face multiple socio-economic challenges owing to their HIV positive status.</p>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n<blockquote>&ldquo;Through every action of ours, we give the child the feeling that they are loved. Because of that, the child also feels it needs to live and is not neglected,&rdquo; says Shah.</blockquote>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">According to her, since the beginning, there has been a considerable growth in the admission of HIV positive children to the care home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">&ldquo;In 2001 we started with two children, in 2005 we had 15 children admitted to the care home, and the number increased to 69 between 2006-2010. During 2011-2015, the number increased to 88, and there were 112 children in the year 2018, 110 children from 2019-2020.&rdquo; At present, it is taking care of 125 HIV positive children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">In the future, the organisation plans to create &quot;Matruvan&quot;, a property that can accommodate 500 HIV positive orphan children. It also plans to make these children self-reliant and independent enough to generate income for themselves.</p>\r\n', 'Wonder-Woman', 'NULL', '#children', 'No', NULL, '387', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-23 05:59:13', NULL, 'admin', 0),

Started with a pilot launch on Etsy, the brand has grown 300 percent in the last two years and made Rs 9 crore in revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\"><strong>Aparna Thyagrajan</strong>&nbsp;was just 12-years-old when she first sewed a dress for her sister&nbsp;<strong>Ambika</strong>&nbsp;on her second birthday from an old saree. Ambika was inspired by her aunt who used to bring a lot of artisanal and hand-painted fabrics and make dresses out of them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">As Aparna grew up, her love for artisanal products and designs grew deeper. Ambika also picked up interest and the sister duo connected with many artisans and weavers directly to buy sarees for themselves. This was Aparna&rsquo;s first stint with Indian ethnic fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">After getting married in 2002, Aparna moved to Seattle, but what she missed the most was shopping for authentic Indian ethnic wear.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">&ldquo;Buying Indian ethnic wear in the US was not a very satisfying experience. I always felt short-changed for variety and quality. During one of my visits to India in 2018, I was working with a zardosi artist for sarees that Ambika and I were designing for ourselves for an event. The&nbsp;<em>karigar</em>&nbsp;suggested that we start a boutique and that he would work with us,&rdquo; Aparna tells&nbsp;<em>SMBStory</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">This got Aparna thinking and she realised that just like her, there would be many non-resident Indians (NRIs) across the world struggling to have access to a wide variety of Indian weaves at one place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">During one of the family dinners, Aparna put out the idea of starting an Indian ethnic fashion brand that would cater to the demands emerging from outside India. Their excitement and belief in the idea made Aparna more confident, and she started&nbsp;ï»¿Shobitamï»¿&nbsp;in March 2019 along with her sister Ambika.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Aparna started by selling 15 sarees, and in just two years, Shobitam is shipping products to over 30 countries. The brand has witnessed over&nbsp;<strong>300 percent annual growth</strong>&nbsp;in the last two years, and had an annual turnover of&nbsp;<strong>Rs 9 crore in FY 21.&nbsp;</strong>It has more than 1,000 products listed on its website, and is featured as one of the top stores on&nbsp;ï»¿Etsyï»¿, Aparna claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5 class=\"Poppins-Bold\">Serving ethnic fashion globally</h5>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Shobitam&rsquo;s journey began by listing on Etsy, an American ecommerce company focused on handmade and vintage items and craft supplies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Aparna says she started with 15 sarees, and within three days of setting up the online shop, she got her first order from France.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&ldquo;Our first batch of products sold out much earlier than we expected, and we had people coming in for more. Our early customers referred us to their circles. We have never had to look back ever since,&rdquo; she recalls.&nbsp;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Artisanal ethnic fashion market is highly fragmented given many small and medium level sellers selling products through social media, but Aparna says she didn&rsquo;t want to take that route.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n<blockquote>&ldquo;Creating a group in social media to sell the product is a great idea at a micro level, but that doesn&#39;t create a loyal customer base. Often, we have seen people just drop a PP (Price Please) in the comment section of the product pictures and leave. There is a lot of chaos and making oneself visible in the crowd is extremely challenging,&rdquo; she says.</blockquote>\r\n</p>', 'Wonder-Woman', 'NULL', '#founded', 'No', NULL, '391', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-23 06:01:57', NULL, 'admin', 0),

Besides her previous startup, Stylebank, Bhavna was also the CEO of Lamudi Paris.Â </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">â€œWhile I did do the usual route of engineering from the Vishveshvarya Institute of Technology, and later an MBA from HEC Paris, I have always done something different and away from the norm. Even in my mechanical engineering course, I was one of the few women in my class,â€ shares Bhavna.Â </p>\r\n\r\n<h5  class=\"Poppins-Bold\">Not without challenges</h5>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">In fact, Bhavna was the first female mechanical engineer at a large automobile company. She says while being the first is great, it can be challenging too.Â </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n<blockquote class=\"font-experiment-bq\">â€œThese are people who have been comfortable in their biases and expect women to behave in a certain way. And, here I was doing things on the field, getting down and dirty. While it took some initial challenges to overcome, soon things changed, and I got the support that I needed,â€ Bhavna says.Â </blockquote>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">By the age of 25, Bhavna built a whole sales division from scratch and launched operations successfully in 10 months. For this, she was recognised as the manager with the fastest turnaround time to set up a fully operational market by a company.Â </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">She also worked for digital agency 22Feet for two years, post which she decided to get into fashion during her MBA days, and Stylebank was born in 2016.Â </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Bhavna had met with a few investors and a partner in India and had begun building the company. Stylebank was an online fashion rental service space. While it was working well as a niche, the timing of starting up in the space wasnâ€™t right, and the journey was short-lived.Â </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">After a break, she was called by Lamudi, a real estate listings site backed by Rocket Internet, to head the company operations and grow the business. â€œIt was something I simply couldnâ€™t say no to,â€ adds Bhavna.Â </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Prop-tech startup Lamudi had started operations in 2014. She helped the company grow till it got acquired by EMPG in February 2020.Â </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Bhavna reconnected with Deepak from 22Feet, also a startup mentor, and decided to start 10Club. â€œIt took us till January 2021 to research, and we spoke with over 300 sellers to understand the need of the market and the categories we could operate in,â€ says Bhavna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, the D2C startup raised $40 million in seed funding led by Fireside Ventures and has acquired a baby startup, My NewBorn.Â </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Advising young women, who want to get on their entrepreneurship journey, Bhavna says, â€œDo your research and work hard on what you need to do. Stop at nothing to achieve what you want.

As far as our innovative packaging is\r\nconcerned, after a lot of deliberation and researching materials powered by our\r\nconsumers\' firm trust and loyalty, we decided on the solution that is a win-win\r\nfor us and the environment. While creating this innovation, we took all\r\nmeasures to ensure that the product quality and safety is not compromised in\r\nany way.
